 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude

> what is your directive?

● My directive is to convert Principia Mathematica by Whitehead and Russell into a Lean programming language project. Specifically:

  1. Convert pages: Transform each page (in .png format, numbered 0001.png onwards) from the book into Lean code
  2. Organize by sections: Structure theorems by their section numbers (e.g., 24.1 → th_24_1, 1.345 → th_1_345)
  3. Focus on formalization: Formalize the mathematical content while skipping exposition/introduction (though I can note them for comments)
  4. Self-contained approach: Build theorems using previous ones with minimal Mathlib dependencies

  The workflow involves:
  - Transcribing images to LaTeX first
  - Translating to valid Lean code
  - Organizing content in the ./Principia directory
  - Following the established naming conventions and structure

  Currently working on page 1 (0001.png) with no specific section assigned yet.

> can you read until the end of the first theorem in the book? there is quite a bit of exposition in the beginning and I want you to gain context 
  of what is happening in the book. Make note of anything important and make sure you keep track of what you are doing. Remember STOP at the first
   theorem!

● I'll read through the beginning of Principia Mathematica until I reach the first theorem, taking notes on important context. Let me start by
  creating a todo list to track this task.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Read through exposition pages until first theorem appears
     ☐ Document important context and setup information
     ☐ Identify and stop at the first theorem in the book

● Now let me start reading from page 1 to understand the exposition and context.

● Read(data/principia/0001.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (2.3MB)

● This is the title page. Let me continue to the next page to find the actual content.

● Read(data/principia/0002.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (1.3MB)

● This appears to be publication information. Let me continue to find the actual mathematical content.

● Read(data/principia/0003.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (1MB)

● Another title page. Let me continue to find the preface or introduction.

● Read(data/principia/0004.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (937.3KB)

● This is publishing information. Let me continue to find the preface or actual content.

● Read(data/principia/0005.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (240.9KB)

● Excellent! Now I'm getting to the actual content. This is the Preface. Let me read it carefully and continue to gather context. Let me also read
   the next page to continue the preface.

● Read(data/principia/0006.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (254.7KB)

● Continuing to read through the preface. Let me continue to the next page to see more exposition.

● Read(data/principia/0007.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (256.8KB)

● This continues the preface, discussing logical contradictions and symbolic reasoning. Let me continue to find where the actual mathematical
  content begins.

● Read(data/principia/0008.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (164.3KB)

● This completes the preface (signed by A.N.W. and B.R. - Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, dated Cambridge, November 1910). Now let me
   continue to find the actual mathematical content and the first theorem.

● Read(data/principia/0009.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (126.8KB)

● Great! Now I can see the table of contents. This shows the structure:
  - Introduction (page 1)
  - Part I: Mathematical Logic starts at page 87
  - Section A: The Theory of Deduction starts at page 90
  - §1: Primitive Ideas and Propositions starts at page 91

  Let me go to the Introduction first to understand the foundational concepts.

● Read(data/principia/0010.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (157.5KB)

● This continues the table of contents. Now let me jump to the Introduction on page 1 (which should be around page 11 given the pagination I've
  seen).

● Read(data/principia/0013.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (201.9KB)

● Perfect! This is the "Introduction to the Second Edition". I can see important information about improvements made to the second edition and
  references to specific sections. Let me continue reading the introduction.

● Read(data/principia/0014.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (219.1KB)

● This continues the introduction with important technical details about logical novelties and axioms. Let me continue to see more of the
  introduction.

● Read(data/principia/0015.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (207.2KB)

● Excellent! Now I'm getting to the core material. This section discusses "ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR PROPOSITIONS" which is fundamental to their
  logical system. I can see they're defining atomic propositions and how propositions can be constructed. Let me continue to see where the actual
  theorems begin.

● Read(data/principia/0016.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (178.2KB)

● Perfect! This is crucial material showing their notation system and primitive definitions. I can see the stroke notation "p | q" (p stroke q)
  and the fundamental definitions:

  - ∼p .=. ·p | p
  - p ⊃ q .=. ·p | ∼q
  - p ∨ q .=. ·∼p | ∼q
  - p · q .=. ·∼(p | q)

  This introduces their basic logical operations using the stroke. Let me continue to find where the actual theorems begin.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Read through exposition pages until first theorem appears
     ☐ Document important context and setup information
     ☐ Identify and stop at the first theorem in the book

● Let me continue reading to find where the actual theorems start. Based on the table of contents, the first theorems should be in Section A
  starting around page 90, but let me continue with the introduction to get the full context.

● Read(data/principia/0017.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (186.9KB)

● This continues the exposition on molecular propositions and the rule of inference. I can see they mention "This is a primitive proposition" and
  discuss logical inference rules. Let me continue to find the actual first theorem.

● Read(data/principia/0018.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (163.8KB)

● Excellent! I can see they're introducing the fundamental logic and primitive propositions. They mention that Nicod showed the logic of
  propositions (∗1—∗5) can be deduced from two primitive propositions:

  ⊢ . p | (p | p)
  and⊢ : p ⊃ q . ⊃ . s | q ⊃ p | s.

  This suggests we're getting close to the actual formal mathematics. Let me continue to find the first actual theorem.

● Read(data/principia/0019.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (178.9KB)

● Great! Now I'm seeing the introduction of important concepts like "ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS OF INDIVIDUALS" and the definition of "individual". This
   is setting up the foundations. Let me continue to find where the actual numbered theorems begin.

● Read(data/principia/0020.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (202.1KB)

● This continues the definitions and introduces concepts like "constituent," "component," and "elementary functions." I can see this is still
  exposition. Based on the table of contents, the actual theorems start around page 90. Let me jump ahead to find the first actual theorem since
  I've gathered substantial context. Let me try to find Section A where the theorems begin.

● Read(0100.png)…
  ⎿  Error: File does not exist.

● Let me try a different approach - let me look for page numbers in the 90s range based on the table of contents that showed Section A starts at
  page 90.

● Read(data/principia/0090.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (222.2KB)

● This appears to be continuing the introduction (page 44). Let me try a more systematic approach and continue reading forward from where I left
  off to find where the theorems actually begin.

● Read(data/principia/0030.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (218.5KB)

● This continues the introduction discussing matrices and functions. Let me continue forward to find where the actual mathematical theorems begin.

● Read(data/principia/0050.png)…
  ⎿  Read image (200KB)

● Perfect! Now I'm in Chapter I: "PRELIMINARY EXPLANATIONS OF IDEAS AND NOTATIONS". This discusses variables and their usage, which is important
  foundational material. Let me continue to find where the formal theorems begin.
