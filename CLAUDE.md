# Task
You are tasked with converting the book, Principia Mathematica by Whitehead and Russell into a project in the Lean programming language.
You are given access to each page in the .png format where each page from cover to cover is labeled from a number starting from 1 with 4 leading zeros (e.g. 0024.png for the 24th image/page from the cover)
You will be writing to lean files by their corresponding section.
You should organize the theorems into the corresponding section number (e.g. 24.1 -> th_24_1, 1.345 -> th_1_345)
Do not formalize the exposition and introduction, but you may make note of them for helpful comments or to reference them in the future.

Below is a sample of what should be done:

An excerpt from the Theory of Deduction section in the Principia:

“The purpose of the present section is to set forth the first stage of the
deduction of pure mathematics from its logical foundations. This first stage is
necessarily concerned with deduction itself, i.e., with the principles by which
conclusions are inferred from premises.”

I used the word "th" to replace "*" and underscore "_" to replace
"·" in the Principia. For example, Theorem "*2·08" becomes "th_2_08".

Any comment related to a specific theorem should precede the theorem and never
follow it. Quoted comments are those made in the Principia concerning a
particular theorem or definition.

Except for a very few usages of Mathlib's builtin logic theorems, this work is
expected to be self-contained­meaning that almost all of the theorems are
derived using previous ones.

--- ∗1.1: Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true.

--- “This principle states: ‘If q is true, then ‘p or q’ is true.’ Thus e.g., if
--- q is ‘to-day is Wednesday’ and p is ‘to-day is Tuesday,’ the principle
--- states: ‘If to-day is Wednesday, then to-day is either Tuesday or
--- Wednesday.’ It is called the ‘principle of addition,’ because it states that
--- if a proposition is true, any alternative may be added without making it
--- false. the principle will be referred to as ‘Add.”

--- *1.4 ⊢: p ∨ q . ⊃ . q ∨ p

--- “This principles states that ‘p or q’ implies ‘q or p.’ It states the
--- permutative law for logical addition of proposition, and will be called the
--- ‘principle of permutation’ because it states that if a proposition is true,
--- any alternative may be added without making it false. The principle will be
--- referred to as ‘Perm.’
theorem th_1_4 (p q: Prop) : (p ∨ q → q ∨ p) := by

--- *1.5 ⊢: p ∨ (q ∨ r) . ⊃ . ∨ (p ∨ r)

--- “This principle states: ‘If either p is true, or ‘q or r’ is true, then
--- either q is true, or ‘p or r’ is true.’ It is a form of the associative law
--- for logical addition, and will be called ‘associative principle.’ It will be
--- referred to as ‘Assoc.’ The proposition p ∨ (q ∨ r) . ⊃ . (p ∨ q) ∨ r, which
--- would be the natural form for the associative law, has less deductive power,
--- and is therefore not taken as the primitive proposition.

### Things to Note
We should transcribe the image into LaTeX before trying to translate the details of a page into the Lean project.
We should make sure that the theorems we are writing are correct and valid with Lean.
We should remember that the image to LaTeX conversion is lossy and not all of the symbols will be translated over perfectly and we will need to use the context to figure out what the proper translation is.

### Memory
The parent directory of the pages is: `./data/principia/`
The lean project directory is in: `./Principia`
I am currently on:
 - page filename: 0136.png (Section 1 start) - 0141.png (contains *1.2-*1.5)
 - section: Section 1 - Primitive Ideas and Propositions
 - Key pages: 0136.png (Section 1 intro), 0139.png (*1.01 definition), 0141.png (*1.2-*1.5 theorems)

**Structure**: All sections properly import their dependencies and build systematically
**Note**: Section 5 doesn't exist - transitions to lettered sections (A, B, C, etc.)

### Next Steps
- Explore lettered sections (A, B, C, etc.) for formal mathematical developments
- Continue building on the solid logical foundation established in Sections 1-4
